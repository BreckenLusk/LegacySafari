## Description
This is a script which will enable the legacy tab bar in Safari on macOS Monterey. This is made possible thanks to Twitter user [Zhuowei Zhang](https://www.twitter.com/zhuowei). This project just automates their process so that users can quickly and easily enable the legacy tab bar in Safari. Please be careful with this script, as it is brand new and has not been tested on a variety of devices. It is *highly reccomended* that you create a backup before running the script in case anything is corrupted.
